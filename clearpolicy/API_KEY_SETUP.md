# How to Get Real API Keys for ClearPolicy

This guide walks you through getting API keys to enable live data (real bills, propositions, and representatives) instead of sample data.

## Step-by-Step: Get All Three Keys

## After Adding Keys

1. Save the `.env` file
2. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/pranilraichura/OpenPolicy/clearpolicy
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Refresh the browser (http://localhost:3000)
4. The "Live data temporarily unavailable" banner should disappear
5. Search for a bill → you'll see real results!

## Verify Keys Are Working

Test each API:

1. **Congress.gov:** Search "health care" → should show real federal bills
2. **Open States:** Search "education" → should show real CA bills
3. **Google Civic:** Enter any ZIP (e.g., 95014) → should show real representatives

---

## Troubleshooting

**"API key missing" error:**
- Make sure you saved the `.env` file
- Restart the dev server after editing `.env`

**"Rate limit exceeded":**
- You're making too many requests too fast
- Wait 1 minute and try again
- Consider adding delays in searches

**Congress.gov approval pending:**
- Wait up to 24 hours for email approval
- Check spam folder

**No results showing:**
- The search might genuinely have no matches
- Try common terms like "health", "education", "environment"

---

## Free Tier Limits

All three APIs have free tiers suitable for testing:

- **Congress.gov:** Unlimited (educational/research use)
- **Open States:** 2,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Google Civic:** 1,000 requests/day (free tier)

For CAC submission, these limits are more than enough.

## Submit to CAC Without Keys?

The app works with sample data for CAC! Judges understand that API approvals take time. You can:

1. Submit with sample data (app fully functional)
2. Mention in your demo video: "Live API integration ready; awaiting approval"
3. Note in submission materials that real keys will enable live data

The technical implementation is identical—only the data source changes.
